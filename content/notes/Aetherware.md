### History

Aetherware (a portmanteau of aether and hardware) is a top secret research project currently being developed by Dr Foveen Inkehill, senior researcher at [[notes/Guilds and Organisations/The Alchemist Guild]]. Building on top of pre-existing prosthetic technology,  the aim of the project is to enhance the abilities of their subjects beyond their normal humanoid capabilities.
One of the blackest of black projects, very few within the guild are even aware of the projects existence, with access to the research data kept on a need to know basis.

*"Finally! After years of hard work we have finally had a breakthrough! Readings in the subject were stable and even with early prototype arm augments their strength increased by almost 46% compared to previous tests. Subject is showing some considerable signs of soulburn but we shall overcome that obstacle with time"* - An excerpt from Dr Inkrhill's research diary, 14th Asm. 928EE

Unlike the prosthetics used by amputees across Bacresia daily, Aetherware's massive power consumption requires an energy source both powerful enough whilst being light enough to not hinder the user. Early prototypes used [[notes/Encyclopaedia/Aethercore]]s, however the fragility of them, along with bulky size required for appropriate energy storage made unsuitable for this application.

After months of dead ends and unsatisfactory results, they finally found the answer; Soulgate 

### 'Soulgate' Power Core Augmentation

The result of countless hours of research, soulgate is a revolutionary magitek implant created to harness the natural aetheric energy within all living beings. The details on how it works are a closely guarded secret however the results speak for themselves. Aetherware equipped by a subject with a Soulgate installed found significant improvement in both strength and usability.
Uncovered research notes hint at serious side effects due to excessive used of stored aetheric energy, resulting in both physical and mental disruption in all of the subjects tested. As the normal humanoid body cannot generate the power required to use modern aetherware effectively, a 'Soulgate' power core augmentation is **required** before the installation of any Tier 1 or above aetherware augmentation. Any augmentation below Tier 1 (such as a normal prosthesis) is entirely useable without one, however installation of a 'Soulgate' is currently only possible by Dr Inkehill or a member of his medical team. There is however a limit to the amount of power that can be generated, with increased power draw linked to possible side effects. 


### Augmentation

Once the powercore has been installed and onlined, the user may then undergo augmentation using any 'Soulgate' compatible aetherware augmentation. This is possible by most artificers with appropriate prosthetic knowledge, however more skilled artificers will be able to install aetherware which uses power more efficiently.
Initial prototyping and subsequent production of augmentations was undertaken by 4 of the biggest arms manufacturers in Bacresia;

Dacia Armoury
Alchemy Guild Research Labs
Dothri & Samnari

Empire Steel

Each have produced a limited run of augmentations for civilian, industrial and military use and are eager for real world usage data.


### Mechanics & Installation

1. User has a 'Soulgate' Augmentation installed. This enables usage of Aetherware augmentations and gives the player access to the Aetherware Managment System (AMS), used to keep track of the user's total remaining power (known as Soul Strength), as well as any negative side effects.
   *Access to AMS spreadsheet used to track your Aetherware. Total Soul strength is calculated from your RAW stats
   (Stats before any additions from magical items or augmentations. You may include stats granted by feats) and your class. If Multiclassing, select the class with the highest level


2. User purchases/acquires a piece of Aetherware and the services of a appropriately skilled artificer. Each piece of Aetherware has a base cost of 'Soul Burn', the amount of the user's Soul Strength used to power it which cannot be reduced. As this is still a new technology, the skill of the artificer can also have a great effect on how well the installation will go. There are no known cases of Aetherware prosthesis rejection, however poorly fitted prosthetics have been shown to use more power than those fitted well. 
   
   *When an augmentation is installed, there is an initial soul burn cost as well as an efficiency cost. The efficiency cost is comprised of 2 main components: Augmentation tier and Artificer skill. The AMS will calculate the efficiency cost for you, however for posterity the formula is as shown below;
   
   Efficiency cost = augment tier die - artificer skill modifier
   
   Where augment tier die;

   Tier 1 = 1d4
    
   Tier 2 = 1d6
   
   Tier 3 = 1d8 
    


	Artificer skill modifier;
	
	Apprentice  -4

	Novice -2

	Journeyman - 0

	Artesian + 2

	Professional + 4

	Master + 6 *


3. Side effects have been observed in those utilizing large amounts of Soul Strength at once. Users are advised to take caution when using the Aetherware system.
   
  *As certain amounts of Soul Strength are used, the user will start to experience side effects. These side effects are shown in the AMS as upgrades are installed and **are cumulative**. The only way to lower the severity of side effects is to reduce the total % max Soul Strength used, either by having augmentations removed or by increasing Soulgate output. Pushing your ‘Soulgate’ past your limit will cause you to become Soulburnt. **This is a permanent death in which your soul is entirely converted to aether. You cannot be brought back.** Consider this your one and only warning. *
