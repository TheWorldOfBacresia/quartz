### Avatar of Death (a.k.a. Death's Long Hand, The Angel of Death)

Hasmed the Annihilator was the first of Lord Death's avatars, and the avatar to which The Lord of Death shares the strongest connection. Designated as Lord Death's Commander during The Eternal Wars, his fierce martial prowess and unwavering loyalty made him a formidable foe in battle, becoming the rival of many of Lord Life's Avatars throughout the ages. Known for wielding his towering war scythe and harnessing the power of his harsh violet aura in battle, Hasmed was instrumental in the eradication of all immortal life in retaliation for The Great Betrayal, an event known as "The Violet Tide".  
  Centuries after, Hasmed found himself above [[Bacresia]], a long since abandoned planet devoid of protectors of Life's domain. Before descending to the planet's surface to investigate, he was engaged by the Guardian moons of Oberon and Titania. Unaware of their existence and unprepared for their onslaught, Hasmed (along with part of the moon Oberon) were obliterated in battle, the remains of both falling to the surface of the planet. His remains burnt by the atmosphere and flung throughout the globe, Hasmed had found himself disconnected from his lord, unable to relay any of the recent information learnt from his brief interaction with the guardians.  
  For thousands of years he slept, his form buried beneath stone and ice until many of his smouldering remains were discovered by an Elf by the name of Baelnor Vaeswan. An inquisitive archaeologist with a knack for the arcane, he managed to commune with the sleeping titan and soon made it his life's work to restore Hasmed to his true form. Using his acquired wealth and influence Baelnor birthed The Children of Hasmed, an organisation created to find the missing pieces of Hasmed and return him to the mortal coil.
