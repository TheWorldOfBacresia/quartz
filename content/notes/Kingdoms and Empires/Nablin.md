An independent nation, Nablin is named after the first Duke, Forynth Nablin. Duke Nablin took in the towns and villages which resisted becoming members of the expanding borders of the [[notes/Kingdoms and Empires/Dirikian Empire]] and [[notes/Kingdoms and Empires/Kingdom of Berya]].    

##### Faction Details

A collection of people who value freedom over not much else, the people under the duke's protection allow all to do as they please, on the condition is does not bring ruin to them or their lands. Any that try often find themselves removed from within their borders... or the moral plane.  

##### Cultural Perks

Due to the strong freedoms given to all free citizens, privacy is a given here. Most do not take advantage of it, however there are rumours of less-than legal magical experiments being carried out by Beryan mages in hidden labs around the citystate. How much of that is true is anyone's guess however.
