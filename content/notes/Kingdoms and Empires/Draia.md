The City-state of Draia is the southern most area on the western continent, a state of strong warriors and craftsmen with a strong affinity to the volcanic hills in which they are born.  

##### Faction Details

Originally founded by shipwrecked humans from the East, the city and it's surrounding towns took to piracy to get through the long winter months. Soon learning to harness the volcanos and rich metal ores which surrounded the settlements, the Draians soon learnt that trading their grappling hooks for hammers was far more safer (and profitable). In modern times, the ancient techniques put Draian steel at almost the same standard as that forged in the furnaces of the empire.  

##### Cultural Perks

Continuing the ancient traditions, members of the city state are expected to fight for what they want, resulting in a far more aggressive and dictatorial way of life.
