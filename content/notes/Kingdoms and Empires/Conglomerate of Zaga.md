An alliance of townships and villages, the conglomerate of Zaga are a people with deep spiritual beliefs and a strong connection to the sea.  

##### Faction Details

Due to their aquatic nature, many of the ships (air and otherwise) are manned with crew that grew up within the borders of Zaga. Their "capital", [[notes/Capital Cities/South]] has a thriving network of docks, welcoming new and old ships alike. Along with these docks comes the taverns for the sailors to visit, making [[notes/Capital Cities/South]] the city with the highest tavern per person ration in [[notes/Bacresia]].  

##### Cultural Perks

A strong community spirit and natural teamwork makes Zaga citizens incredibly hospitable, however word of troublemakers or other unsavoury types travels fast between towns. Travelers are advised to ensure they don't gain a bad reputation when within the conglomerates borders.
