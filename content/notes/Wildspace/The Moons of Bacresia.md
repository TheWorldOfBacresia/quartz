# Oberon and Titania

![](notes/assets/twinmoons.png "twinmoons.png")

The twin moons of Oberon and Titania are a common sight in the Bacresian sky, often depicted as guardians of the planet in old folktales. 
Oberon, the largest of the two moons was stuck my something long ago, shattering it's surface and spewing glowing regolith into [[notes/Wildspace/Wildspace]]. Captured between the gravitational pull of the two moons, the beautiful glow lights up both moons in the night sky.
