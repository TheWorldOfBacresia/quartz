Home of the Anor, the Jangwa Desert is famed for its hidden bounties of unusual and exotic gemstones and spices. Strong winter winds often unearth hidden relics and ruins from a time long past, bringing adventures and treasure hunters from far and wind to these dangerous sands.   Legends speak of an ancient empire which once spread to the edges of the continent, more advanced than even the kingdoms of today. Able to harness the magic of creation, they built vast crystalline pillars that were said to harvest the magic from the stars themselves, harnessing it for their flying machines and grand citadels. Fairytales involving their wonderous magic and technology are common bedtime stories for the children of [[Faymouth]], and even now there are archaeologists who have spent their lives looking for any evidence of this wonderous civilization.
