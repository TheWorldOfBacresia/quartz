Deep in the Dirikian Mountains the skull of some gigantic monster known only as "Titan" protrudes from the bedrock walls. Infused with magic, it's bones glisten with the stereotypical blue hue of titanium. Etymologists cannot agree which came first, the name of the metal in which it's bones seem to be fused with or the creature itself. Either way, they all agree that we should be thankful the creature does not still walk the lands today.
