A forest of crystalline trees enveloped in a purple mist, the sound of footsteps deep in this forest are met with a ringing from the crystal leaves and branches. Light and magical energy focused through these crystals is amplified by orders of magnitude, however their fragile nature makes them extremely difficult to harvest. Rumours of fae creatures have begun to spread in the surrounding areas, with witnesses swearing that that they saw all sorts of fantastical creatures roaming.
