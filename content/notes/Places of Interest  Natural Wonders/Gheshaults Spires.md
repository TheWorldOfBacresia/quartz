Spires of white crystalline rock, upon closer inspection are made up of thousands of tiny hexagons. Lower sections have been used as watchtowers and weather stations for centuries. Pressing your ear to these ancient obelisks, a low hum can be heard, most likely reverberations from passing wind currents. Their white surface is almost reflective, often taking on the colour of the sky above it.
