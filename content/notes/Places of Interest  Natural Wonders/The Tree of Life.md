A tree who's trunk is the thickness of a small town and who's roots spread for hundreds of miles, The Tree of Life's canopy reaches far into the sky, some say to the heavens themselves. The streams and rivers that flow towards its great trunk are thought to be blessed with healing properties, with many believing drinking their waters brings good luck. Also a prime destination for weddings.
