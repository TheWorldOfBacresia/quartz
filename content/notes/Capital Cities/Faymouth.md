[[notes/Kingdoms and Empires/Kingdom of Faymouth]]

## Description
Born from ruins of the old Elven city, the capital city of the realm is a central trade hub for the west, importing and exporting good from across [[Bacresia]]. Anything and everything is available within these borders, leading to a thriving black market. The [[Darkforest Isles]] to the north bring researchers and zoologists from around the world, flocking there to observe the unique habitats and creatures that reside there. The kingdom is protected by the native Dragonborn, using their natural leadership and strength to protect the trade caravans which travel across the continent.

### Demographics
The great trade city has a varied demographic, filled with an assortment of people form all over the world. Dragonborn and Orcs from the east are common sights on the streets, as well as wood elves whose ancestors travelled to the mainland from the [[Darkforest Isles]] centuries ago. As with most places on the planet humans seem to have taken up residence in the city, joined by a smaller number of Goblins and Tieflings from the north.  


### Defences
A considerable navy defends many of the more wealthy shipping lines in and out of Faymouth, helping to drive off any opportunistic privateers hoping to plunder the riches crossing the seas to the east. Inland, the city is protected by the city guard, many of whom are mercenaries from [[notes/Guilds and Organisations/The Adventurer's Guild]]


### Industry & Trade
Due to the sheer amount of trade occurring within it's walls, the city's entire economy is supported by trade taxes and gold spent by traders and visitors staying within the city. Because of this, most citizens make an effort to learn a trade which takes advantage of this unique scenario, resulting in a well trained and educated populace.  

### Infrastructure

The city's docks are open around the clock, bringing goods too and from the city at a pace not seen anywhere else in Bacresia. Unlike the [[notes/Encyclopaedia/Aethercore]] powered machines, goods are transported throughout the city by more traditional means. 


### Districts

#### Ravensway
One of the less affluent parts of the city, Ravensway consists of mostly residential buildings for the working population, along with the taverns and gambling establishments that often pop up around these areas of cities.

#### Clear Valley
The centre of the city, Clear Valley houses Feymouth Castle, as well as the royal courtyard. 

#### The Grove
Connected to the Breaddocks to the north, The Grove became the financial hub of the city. This district is home to most of the high end stores, as well as importers and exporters of trade goods. The centre of the district also contains what remains of it's namesakes greenery, reportedly dating back to the first Elven settlement over a thousand years ago

#### Knightsbridge
Once the home to the kingdom's legions, Knightsbridge now houses the more wealthy citizens of the city, along with some of the nicer taverns and the area's biggest recreational area, Ivy Grove park

#### East Gate
The industrial heart of the city, East Gate is the district that never sleeps. Dockworkers unload raw materials around the clock while smugglers sneak their wares between shipments.

#### The Docks
The lifeblood of the city, the Breaddocks and Ghostdocks work throughout the night to load and unload cargo from the non-stop aerial and sea bound vessels of [[Bacresia]].  

#### Fairy Yard
Having once thought to house a magical portal to the Faewilds, the Fairy Yard boats a large number of magical and mundane shops mainly aimed at visitors. It's also home to one of the best magical tattooists in the realm
