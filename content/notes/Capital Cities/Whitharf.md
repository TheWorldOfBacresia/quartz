## Description
Nestled at the foot of a sleeping volcano, Whitharf and her people are no strangers to the perils of living in a hostile environment. A city of metalworkers and stonemasons, each gives their time to protect and support the city, whether by keeping the city's infrastructure protected against the corrosive gasses that seep from the surrounding mountains or arming themselves to defend against the hordes of elementals which seem to accompany volcanic eruptions. Overlooking the city are two bronze titans, protectors of the city. 


### Demographics
Due to the harsh and inhospitable lands, most of of the original inhabitants of the continent found themselves here by necessity. This shows in the population, as nearly all of the citizens are descendants of those who first landed on these shores centuries ago. Because of this, nearly all the population are humans, with small collections of tieflings who seem unfazed by the warm and dry climate. 


### Defences
Due to the unique appearance of elemental hordes which besiege the city on a quinquennial basis, Whitharf is by far the most well defended of all of the capital cities of [[Bacresia]]. The city walls themselves sit at 30ft, with defensive towers overlooking the city and it's surrounding lands. To help repel any invaders, the city guard are outfitted and trained as a standing army, ready to come to the city's defence at a moments notice. 


### Industry & Trade
Home to a forging technique which is found nowhere else on the planet, Draian steel is an extremely hot commodity. Used in many specialist applications such as [[notes/Encyclopaedia/Aethercore]] engines and high quality weapon manufacture, many smiths will travel to [[notes/Kingdoms and Empires/Draia|Draia]] to learn about this amazing material 

### Infrastructure
Constant ash clouds make air travel difficult, so much of the trade flowing through the city occurs via cargo ships or along the vast road network that covers the continent. Although often damaged by the earthquakes, these roads are quickly repaired and used by most on a daily basis.
