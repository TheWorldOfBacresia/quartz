## Description
With its skies filled with airships and automated barges filling the canals, Fasinter is the city that never sleeps. Relying much on the wonders of [[notes/Encyclopaedia/Aethercore|aethercore]]s  and the magitec automatons created by their famed artificers, this centre of magical learning is lauded and feared in equal measure by those outside of the kingdom. 


### Demographics

The city of Fasinter has a largely human population, making up around 70% of the inhabitants.  The remaining 30% are made up mostly of Elves (around 20%) and a small population of gnomes (10%).

### Defences

The defences of Fasinter have continued to grow as the city itself has expanded over the many centuries. The most oblivious evidence of this are the multiple rings of walls which help to distinguish the different districts of the city. Looking towards the centre of the city, the many towers and multifloored buildings are dwarfed by the sheer scale of the grand citadel. Large enough to house both commercial and military airship ports within it's "lower" sections, this citadel was built by the first king of Berya and has been expanded upon by each royal since.

### Industry & Trade

A city built upon industry and trade, Fasinter's industrial and trade districts are some of the largest in the world, housing vast factories and warehouses filled with all sorts of goods ready to be sent across [[Bacresia]]. Located deeper within the city limits, beyond the market and factory quarters you will find a large district filled with tall and glistening towers. Often the centre of many of the mishaps in the city, the magic and alchemy district of Fasinter is the home to many of the magical guilds of [[Bacresia]], by far the largest being [[notes/Guilds and Organisations/The Alchemist Guild|The Alchemist guild]].

### Infrastructure

Interlaced with canals, Fasinter's main method of transporting goods around the city is aboard unmanned, [[notes/Encyclopaedia/Aethercore]]-powered barges. Often seen loaded with good and raw materials being transported from the docks situated to the south-east of the city, these barges run 24 hours a day, feeding the great Beryan industrial machine. Along with these canals, an airship dock can be found within the lower levels of the palace citadel, located at the centre of the city.
