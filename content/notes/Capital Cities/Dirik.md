## Description
An architectural marvel, the capital off the [[notes/Kingdoms and Empires/Dirikian Empire]] showcases the best of it's Dwarven and Elven citizens ingenuity and craftsmanship. By melding these two contrasting architectural styles together, Dirikian craftsmen have managed to mix elegance and utilitarianism in a way unseen before.

### Demographics
Other than a small minority of humans, the vast majority of Dirik's citizens are either Dwarfs or Elves, with many proudly boasting how far back they can trace their linage back to the first settling of the mountains and surrounding grasslands.


### Defences
As the city's footprint is made up of many interconnecting river islands, each island in the chain is defended by it's own walls and keep, making any sort of attempt of siege an even more slow and arduous task. 


### Industry & Trade
As the main hub for metal and woodcrafting in the empire, the city is home to a vast number of hordes containing millions of gold pieces worth of raw materials.  Collected from throughout the continent, the buying and selling of these commodities is carried out by a collection of auction houses run in part by the [[notes/Guilds and Organisations/Alabaster Trading Company]]. This vast network of warehouses and trade is rivalled only by city of [[notes/Capital Cities/Faymouth]], with trade disputes and shipping disruptions becoming the norm between their respective diplomats. 

### Infrastructure
Dirik has strong connections by both river and road, as well as a sizable airship dock open throughout the day and night. Recent improvements in [[notes/Encyclopaedia/Aethercore]] technology have resulted in renewed interest in ground-based mass transit of raw materials. News has recently spread of [[notes/Guilds and Organisations/The Alchemist Guild]] and [[notes/Kingdoms and Empires/Dirikian Empire]] artificers working on a monstrous trolley system linking the city with the great mines to the north east, increasing the amount of ore capable of being transferred by orders of magnitude.
