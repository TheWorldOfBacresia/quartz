### Demographics

South is made up of a vast mixture of people, with around 55% of them claiming Orc or Half-Orc ancestry. A further 35% of the city's inhabitants are Anor humans whose ancestors travelled East from [[Faymouth]] into the [[Conglomerate of Zaga]] and settled. The other 10% is mostly made up of theÂ Yotunni Dragonborn, many stationed in the city to act as city guard, however there are some who live in the city and enjoy a more quest life.

### Defences

Located in a natural harbour, much of South is defended by the rough terrain surrounding it, with [[Yotunn]]-led guardsman protecting the city and it's outskirts. The seaways of South are protected by the Conglomerate's navy, a vast number of vessels who not only protect the shipping routes from pirates, but also police the seas within Zaga's borders.

### Industry & Trade

South is home to some of the biggest and best shipwrights in the world, responsible for around 70% of all seaworthy vessels currently in use today. With waiting lists for Southern-built ships going back years, owning one of these new ships has become a status symbol in it's own right. Along with it's shipbuilding, South has a thriving fishing industry, catching much of the city's dietary needs on a nightly basis.

### Infrastructure

With much of the city built on water, transporting of good and general travel around the city is done on small skiffs, many powered by magic or small [[Aethercore]] engines. Officially, all goods must go through the main harbour for custom checks and the like, however many a warehouse have been paying extra for transport ships to pull along side these establishments and unload directly into their waiting carriages, purely for the sake of efficiency. As many had predicted however this custom has created a booming black market in South, with many "entrepreneurs" setting up shop either at the edges of the city or upon their own skiffs.
