A northern culture of the west, Lothians tend to live in smaller settlements, relying on hunting to sustain their meat-heavy diet. Although their metalworking skills are seen as inferior when compared to other surrounding cultures, Lothian tailoring is second to none. Tales are sung about the grand silks and robes woven with Lothian hands, and Lothian crafts are found on the backs of noblemen and mages across [[Bacresia]].
