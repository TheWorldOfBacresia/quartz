# Drandar

The culture found centre of the Eastern continent, the Drandar people are workers (and exploiters) of the land. Masters of agriculture, miles of magical irrigation and blooming fields are not an uncommon sight surrounding Drandar towns. Those that choose to live in the temperate rainforests near the equator enjoy a slower life, spending their time hunting or fishing the abundant wildlife. The past druidic and shamanistic folklore of these people is still seen today in Drandarian architecture and food.
