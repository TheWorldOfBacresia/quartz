Originally hailing from the [[Draia]] islands, their proximity to the southern volcanos and their metallic bounties forged the men and women Dail society into both fierce crafters and fighters. Early Dail ships were known to raid Uruki vessels transporting goods between the islands and mainland, resulting in gaining the reputation for piracy. Although that time has long past, there is still animosity between the two cultures.
