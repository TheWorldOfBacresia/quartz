From the south east, Rohandi are natural scholars. Emphasising the importance of an education on their youth, places of learning are revered and treated with the upmost respect. Because of this predisposition towards acquiring knowledge, Rohandi cities often filled with magical and alchemical academics from across the world. Many of the greatest jumps in knowledge have come from Rohandi centres for alchemic and magical enlightenment, subsidiaries of The Alchemists Guild.
