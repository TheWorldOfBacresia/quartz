The Uruk are people of the sea. Whether as fisherman or as a ships crew the Uruki are proud of their seafaring heritage and this is reflected in their culture and day to day life. Individualism is not frowned upon in Uruki culture but each person is expected to work towards the good of the whole, whether it be their family unit, their town or their crew. As accomplished sailors it is common for Uruki to be well travelled, and taverns run by those who found their fortunes in the sea or skies are common around [[notes/Bacresia]].
