Hailing from the grasslands north of "The great sand sea" of The Spice Deserts, Arago goblins live in a semi-organised fashion with recognisable towns and villages, unlike their wildling cousins. Much of their belongings are acquired from trade with the Anor, happy to take warm pelts and furs in payment for trinkets and household items. The Arago have become seasoned veterans of combat, spending much of their time protecting their townships from wildling raids and other local Arago towns. Although uncommon, Arago Goblins have shown some aptitude to magic, although many with the intelligence for magical research tend to leave their homelands in search of knowledge.
