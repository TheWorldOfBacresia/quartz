Yotunn Dragonborn are a militaristic people, priding themselves on their staunch code of honour. Although many join the armies of their nations, it is not uncommon for young Yotunn to travel the world following the life of a mercenary. Whatever their combat background, Yotunnese fights are known for their tactical genius. Though these fine warriors strive themselves as protectors of the peace, their diplomatic skills have much to be desired, with Yotunn commanders known for fighting first and asking questions later.
