# Quenian
 
Industrialists at their core, Quenian dwarves are some of the greatest smiths and craftsman in the lands. Unlike many other races who's towns and cities surround places of worship or political importance, the centre of Quenian settlements is the industrial district. Smoke and heat fill the streets as the great dwarven forges burn throughout the night, the sound of smithies shaping ingots with hammer blows. Not to be forgotten, gnomish inhabitants have fully integrated into Quenian culture, bringing their scientific and engineering expertise.
