An offshoot of the Adventurers Guild, the [[notes/Bacresia]] Historical Artefact Society is an organisation dedicated to the discovery and acquisition of relic and artefacts of eras past. Relying on a contract-based system of job postings, members of the BHAS (colloquially known as the Treasure Hunters guild) will sign themselves up for a job either as an individual or group, depending on the rank the given to the contract. Unless specified in the contract terms, upon completion of the contract the item requested it delivered to the client, with any additional items acquired becoming property of the group who found them. As facilitators of the transaction, the BHAS takes a fee from the client, along with 5% of the GP value of any other collected artefacts.   BHAS contracts are ranked as follows:  

*   **D Rank**  
    The lowest ranked contract available, these can be carried out by new adventurers or a well-prepared single individual.  
      
    
*   **C Rank**  
    Available to newer groups of treasure hunters, these contracts should be no trouble for a prepared group of adventurers.  
      
    
*   **B Rank**  
    Suitable for most experienced parties. Along with C ranks, these contracts make up the bulk of the work undertaken by the BHAS.  
      
    
*   **A Rank**  
    The highest rank contract available for teams of 4-5 members, these contracts will push you to the limit both physically and mentally.  
      
    
*   **S Rank**  
    The highest rank of contract available, these often require multiple parties of high ranking members to work together to complete. The [[notes/Bacresia]] Historical Artefact Society cannot guarantee the lives of members who accept these contracts.
