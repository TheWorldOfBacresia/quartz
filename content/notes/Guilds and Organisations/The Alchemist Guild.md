The Alchemist guild is a collection of the greatest scientific and alchemic minds throughout [[Bacresia]]. Headed by The Master Aetherweaver, their Centres for Alchemic and Magical Enlightenment have become the repositories of all of [[Bacresia]]'s magical knowledge. Through their research it was possible to create and control elemental cores, now a staple of their day to day research and the source of most of the guild's wealth. The guild master, Haemir Varona has been at the helm of the guild for the past 25 years, expanding their political influence with both the [[notes/Kingdoms and Empires/Dirikian Empire]] and the [[notes/Kingdoms and Empires/Kingdom of Berya]]. Membership is granted to those with an astute mind and a thirst for knowledge, however members are expected to contribute to the collected pool of knowledge at least once a year. Failure to do so puts a member at risk of expulsion.
