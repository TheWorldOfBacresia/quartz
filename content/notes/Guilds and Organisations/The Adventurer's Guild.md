Originally founded just outside the city of [[notes/Capital Cities/Faymouth]], The Adventurers Guild is one of the largest multi-nation organisations in [[Bacresia]]. Formed after the second guild war, it's purpose was to act as a support network for beginner and veteran adventurers and act as arbiters on the behalf of the adventuring community.  
An additional responsibility recently taken on by The Adventurers Guild is to become Bacresian Guild registrar. For a small sum, the Adventurers guild can officially declare the creation of a guild and for it to be recognised by the realms of [[Bacresia]]. For more information on guild creation, adventurers are advised to contact their nearest representative (OOC: DM)Â As a member of the Adventurers Guild, you will receive such wonderful bonuses as:

-   Reduced boarding costs at guild associated inns and taverns.
-   5% discount at guild associated merchants.
-   Sanctuary to all members in need.
-   Access to guild-sanctioned quests
