Located in the southern ocean between [[notes/Continents/Valodur]] and [[notes/Continents/Dacia]], the Central Archipelago (colloquially known as the South Sun Isles) is home to many a trading outpost, as well as holiday destination for the more wealthy citizens of [[notes/Bacresia]]. The vast number of people that call the south sun isles home are retired adventurers, many who earned enough coin in their younger years to spend the rest of their days living in comfort or help along those who are still new at adventuring. Due to its central location, both boats and airships are readily available from nearly every city in [[notes/Bacresia]] and bringing with them, large amounts of trade and knowledge.
