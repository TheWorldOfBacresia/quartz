Consisting of the Western continent and the island of [[notes/Kingdoms and Empires/Draia]], Dacia is home to some of the greatest crafters and traders in the world of [[notes/Bacresia]]. Unlike the eastern continent of [[notes/Continents/Valodur]], Dacia's climate shifts largely from area to area, ranging from volcanic wasteland to scorching deserts and frozen tundra. Home to large collection of different cultures and species, the realms of Dacia have existed in relative peace for centuries, growing rich from the vast amounts of trade amongst themselves and realms of [[notes/Continents/Valodur]].
