The home to the [[notes/Kingdoms and Empires/Kingdom of Berya]] and the [[notes/Kingdoms and Empires/Dirikian Empire]], the two largest territories in [[notes/Bacresia]], as well as the free-state of [[notes/Kingdoms and Empires/Nablin]], Valodur is a much more temperate continent when compared to her sister Darcia. Made mostly of grasslands and deciduous forests, the landscape is broken up by an equatorial wetland separating the great nations, as well as mountains stretching east to west at lower latitudes. Build during a rare time of peace between the nations, a great trade road stretches between the grand cities of Farsinter, [[notes/Capital Cities/Velgekh]] and [[notes/Capital Cities/Dirik]]. Often in use even when diplomatic tensions are high, the spread of ideas and culture has meant that the once obvious distain these kingdoms once had for each other has mostly cooled.
