Founded over a thousand years ago, The Order of Golden Judgment is a holy order who's sole mission is to follow the will and teachings of [[Gabriel]]. Sworn to protect all the peoples of Bacresia, they have been called to arms many times in her defence against abyssal and fiendish incursions. Because of their oath to protect all of Bacresia's inhabitants the order keeps themselves out of politics, refusing to involve themselves in the wars of men.
