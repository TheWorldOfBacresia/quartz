The Golden Sea is a magical, dream-like world which exists within the material plane. Said to be where the souls of the dead go, it is believed that The Golden Sea was created long before [[Bacresia]] or even her Gods. For centuries disciples of [[Dumah]] would often visit The Golden Sea while dreaming, communing with the spirits of those who came before and their Patron Goddess, passing on her teachings. As the only people naturally able to enter the sea, some followers of [[Dumah]] were tasked with protecting it, becoming known as [[Dream Guardians]].

Soon after the Gods left [[Bacresia]] many found entering difficult and as time went on, were unable to enter altogether. Centuries had gone by and fewer and fewer followers were able to enter, resulting in the once common occurrence to become a reason for celebration. Recent investigations carried out with the help of [[notes/Guilds and Organisations/The Alchemist Guild]] have found that there seem to be places all around [[Bacresia]] where the barrier between the material plane and the sea are weak, allowing followers of [[Dumah]] to attempt to re-enter. The way in which [[notes/Guilds and Organisations/The Alchemist Guild]] is able to uncover these Golden Rifts (which are invisible to the naked eye) is a closely guarded secret that even those in the Church are unaware of.
