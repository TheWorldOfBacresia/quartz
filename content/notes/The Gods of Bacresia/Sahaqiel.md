The patron deity of seafarers and airshipmen, Sahaqiel the weather weaver moulded the climate of [[notes/Bacresia]] and sits amongst his brothers and sisters on The Pantheon of Creation. Unlike many of the other Gods, Sahaqiel interacted much with the people of [[notes/Bacresia]] before leaving. There are stories of Sahaqiel saving many a fishing boat in the path of a dangerous storm, calming the rushing winds and heavy rain to protect those aboard. Unlike the others on the pantheon, Sahaqiel does not speak a language understood by any of the creatures on [[notes/Bacresia]], as his speach sounds almost like whale song.
