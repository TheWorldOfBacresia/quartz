Raziel the Secret Keeper is a member of The Pantheon of Creation and the source of magic on [[Bacresia]]. Within his great tome are the workings and understandings of the entire universe and all its planes. It is believed that Raziel whispered the secrets of magic in the ears of those he believed worthy while they explored [[The Golden Sea]], with those people awakening to find they were able to manipulate magic in ways that had never been dreamt of. Revered as the all knowing God, legend has it that within the guarded pages dangerous and powerful magic await, kept from mere mortals for their own safety. Some even believe the secret to Godhood is even found within the bindings. Raziel is often depicted as wearing his golden plate armour, even when sat reading from his tome, ready to defend the secrets kept within even when at rest.
