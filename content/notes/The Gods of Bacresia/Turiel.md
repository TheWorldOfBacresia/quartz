Turiel of the hidden bounty is the patron deity of miners and a member of The Pantheon of Creation. Covered in fine jewellery and always seen holding his golden serpent Orochi, he would often sit upon his mountain throne in quiet contemplation while watching the people of [[Bacresia]] excavate the surrounding lands for bounties of rare metals and ore. Watching them work so hard, Turiel often rewarded them with rich mineral veins. Using his divine powers to raise them to the surface, miners would find empty wasteland replaced with seas of easily accessible ore, often overnight and with little warning.  
Upon leaving [[Bacresia]], Turiel supposedly left Orici behind to continue his work in his stead. He is said to sleep within the canopy of [[notes/Places of Interest  Natural Wonders/The Tree of Life|The Tree of Life]].
