Dumah the Dreamer is the patron deity of doctors and healers and a member of The Pantheon of Creation. Skilled in bending the subconscious, she created [[notes/Encyclopaedia/The Golden Sea]], a dream realm in which the soul may explore while the body sleeps. Those who returned from [[notes/Encyclopaedia/The Golden Sea]] are said to have found their wounds healing with expediency and their moods elevated, although most often forget their experience upon waking. Since leaving [[Bacresia]], the ability to enter [[notes/Encyclopaedia/The Golden Sea]] while asleep has become more and more difficult, and followers of Dumah often make it their life goal to enter [[notes/Encyclopaedia/The Golden Sea]] at least once in their lifetime.
