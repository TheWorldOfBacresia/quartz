Liliel, Guardian of the Night is a one of the Gods of Barcesia and a member of The Pantheon of Creation. Sister ofÂ [[notes/The Gods of Bacresia/Dumah]], she acts as the protector of those who have left their bodies to explore [[notes/Encyclopaedia/The Golden Sea]]. Known for her beauty, her golden and silver dress is known to glisten in the moonlight from the twin moons of Oberon and Titania as she patrols the night skies guarding the peaceful sleepers below. Her connection to [[notes/The Gods of Bacresia/Dumah]] runs deep however, and disagreements between the sisters often result in sleepers experiencing almost lifelike nightmares.
