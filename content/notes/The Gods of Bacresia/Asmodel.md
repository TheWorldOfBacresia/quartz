# Asmodel 

Asmodel the Engineer is the patron deity of craftsman and architects and is a member of The Pantheon of Creation. Using hisÂ grand hammer he crafted the planet itself, building the mountains and carving the valleys on which the rest of the pantheon placed their own creations. Responsible for the creation of Oberon and Titania, as well as having gifted the races with the knowledge of metalworking, he is affectionately known as the Forge Farther. Those who follow Asmodel as their Alpha are often seen with brass or gold inlayed into their tools, or wearing an article of purple clothing throughout the month of Asmodel.
