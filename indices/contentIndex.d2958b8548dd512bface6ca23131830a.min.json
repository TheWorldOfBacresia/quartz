Building on top of pre-existing prosthetic technology,  the aim of the project is to enhance the abilities of their subjects beyond their normal humanoid capabilities.\nOne of the blackest of black projects, very few within the guild are even aware of the projects existence, with access to the research data kept on a need to know basis.\n\n*\"Finally! After years of hard work we have finally had a breakthrough! Readings in the subject were stable and even with early prototype arm augments their strength increased by almost 46% compared to previous tests. Subject is showing some considerable signs of soulburn but we shall overcome that obstacle with time\"* - An excerpt from Dr Inkrhill's research diary, 14th Asm. 928EE\n\nUnlike the prosthetics used by amputees across Bacresia daily, Aetherware's massive power consumption requires an energy source both powerful enough whilst being light enough to not hinder the user. Early prototypes used [[notes/Encyclopaedia/Aethercore]]s, however the fragility of them, along with bulky size required for appropriate energy storage made unsuitable for this application.\n\nAfter months of dead ends and unsatisfactory results, they finally found the answer; Soulgate \n\n### 'Soulgate' Power Core Augmentation\n\nThe result of countless hours of research, soulgate is a revolutionary magitek implant created to harness the natural aetheric energy within all living beings. The details on how it works are a closely guarded secret however the results speak for themselves. Aetherware equipped by a subject with a Soulgate installed found significant improvement in both strength and usability.\nUncovered research notes hint at serious side effects due to excessive used of stored aetheric energy, resulting in both physical and mental disruption in all of the subjects tested. As the normal humanoid body cannot generate the power required to use modern aetherware effectively, a 'Soulgate' power core augmentation is **required** before the installation of any Tier 1 or above aetherware augmentation. Any augmentation below Tier 1 (such as a normal prosthesis) is entirely useable without one, however installation of a 'Soulgate' is currently only possible by Dr Inkehill or a member of his medical team. There is however a limit to the amount of power that can be generated, with increased power draw linked to possible side effects. \n\n\n### Augmentation\n\nOnce the powercore has been installed and onlined, the user may then undergo augmentation using any 'Soulgate' compatible aetherware augmentation. This is possible by most artificers with appropriate prosthetic knowledge, however more skilled artificers will be able to install aetherware which uses power more efficiently.\nInitial prototyping and subsequent production of augmentations was undertaken by 4 of the biggest arms manufacturers in Bacresia;\n\nDacia Armoury\nAlchemy Guild Research Labs\nDothri \u0026 Samnari\n\nEmpire Steel\n\nEach have produced a limited run of augmentations for civilian, industrial and military use and are eager for real world usage data.\n\n\n### Mechanics \u0026 Installation\n\n1. User has a 'Soulgate' Augmentation installed. This enables usage of Aetherware augmentations and gives the player access to the Aetherware Managment System (AMS), used to keep track of the user's total remaining power (known as Soul Strength), as well as any negative side effects.\n   *Access to AMS spreadsheet used to track your Aetherware. Total Soul strength is calculated from your RAW stats\n   (Stats before any additions from magical items or augmentations. You may include stats granted by feats) and your class. If Multiclassing, select the class with the highest level\n\n\n2. User purchases/acquires a piece of Aetherware and the services of a appropriately skilled artificer. Each piece of Aetherware has a base cost of 'Soul Burn', the amount of the user's Soul Strength used to power it which cannot be reduced. As this is still a new technology, the skill of the artificer can also have a great effect on how well the installation will go. There are no known cases of Aetherware prosthesis rejection, however poorly fitted prosthetics have been shown to use more power than those fitted well. \n   \n   *When an augmentation is installed, there is an initial soul burn cost as well as an efficiency cost. The efficiency cost is comprised of 2 main components: Augmentation tier and Artificer skill. The AMS will calculate the efficiency cost for you, however for posterity the formula is as shown below;\n   \n   Efficiency cost = augment tier die - artificer skill modifier\n   \n   Where augment tier die;\n\n   Tier 1 = 1d4\n    \n   Tier 2 = 1d6\n   \n   Tier 3 = 1d8 \n    \n\n\n\tArtificer skill modifier;\n\t\n\tApprentice  -4\n\n\tNovice -2\n\n\tJourneyman - 0\n\n\tArtesian + 2\n\n\tProfessional + 4\n\n\tMaster + 6 *\n\n\n3. Side effects have been observed in those utilizing large amounts of Soul Strength at once. Users are advised to take caution when using the Aetherware system.\n   \n  *As certain amounts of Soul Strength are used, the user will start to experience side effects. These side effects are shown in the AMS as upgrades are installed and **are cumulative**. The only way to lower the severity of side effects is to reduce the total % max Soul Strength used, either by having augmentations removed or by increasing Soulgate output. Pushing your ‘Soulgate’ past your limit will cause you to become Soulburnt. **This is a permanent death in which your soul is entirely converted to aether. You cannot be brought back.** Consider this your one and only warning. *\n\n","lastmodified":"2022-10-29T18:03:36.577058215Z","tags":null},"/notes/Atlas":{"title":"","content":"# Atlas \n\n\n### Capital Cities\n[[notes/Capital Cities/Dirik]]\n\n[[notes/Capital Cities/Fasinter]]\n\n[[notes/Capital Cities/Faymouth]]\n\n[[notes/Capital Cities/South]]\n\n[[notes/Capital Cities/The Grand Citadel of Kharia]]\n\n[[notes/Capital Cities/Velgekh]]\n\n[[notes/Capital Cities/Whitharf]]\n\n### Continents\n[[notes/Continents/Central Archipelago]]\n\n[[notes/Continents/Dacia]]\n\n[[notes/Continents/Valodur]]\n\n\n### Places of Interest \u0026 Natural Wonders\n[[notes/Places of Interest  Natural Wonders/Gheshaults Spires]]\n\n[[notes/Places of Interest  Natural Wonders/The Jangwa Desert]]\n\n[[notes/Places of Interest  Natural Wonders/The Singing Canopy]]\n\n[[notes/Places of Interest  Natural Wonders/The Tree of Life]]\n\n[[notes/Places of Interest  Natural Wonders/Titanic Bone Caves]]\n\n\n","lastmodified":"2022-10-29T18:03:36.577058215Z","tags":null},"/notes/Bacresia":{"title":"","content":"#### Welcome to Bacresia!\n--------------------\nThe World of Bacresia is a lush and green world, split into 2 continents with smaller islands (both natural and artificial) throughout the oceans. The vast amount of rain and warm equatorial temperatures have resulted in the lowlands being covered in dense forest. Much of these lands were levelled for inhabitation and agricultural use, but large areas of temperate rainforest still exist, the home of smaller hunting villages and sages. The world seems to have only 2 seasons, summer and winter. Summers Last for the majority of the year, providing a warm and fertile growing season. Large Winters come abruptly and result in a near shutdown of most of the agricultural industries of the world. The long summers however allow adequate store of food to be kept, with famine a worry most in the world have not had in generations.  \nDue to the wet climate, winters are often icy and traveling becomes difficult. Many of the rivers freeze in the winter months and airships have trouble remaining in the air at higher latitudes. Geologically the land is quiet, although the volcanic islands of [[notes/Kingdoms and Empires/Draia]] have many peaks which spew ash and lava on a daily basis. Earthquakes are much more common during the winter, with the vast majority occurring within the first weeks of snowfall.  \n  \n  \nTime and dates are similar to the real world, with 30 day months and 12 month years. Each of the summer months in Bacresia are named after a member of The Pantheon of Creation, the collection of Gods who created the planet and lived amongst the people of Bacresia during the Celestial Era. The days are 24 hours long with the twin moons of Oberon and Titania gracing the skies at night.  \nMust of the land is temperate, however the topography of Bacresia results in some vastly different and clearly separate biomes. Though uncommon, it is not unknown to find large quantities of resources within small patches of land. Acres of land with unrivalled fertility or tons of easily accessible surface ore have been found throughout Bacresia and as many people flocked to these areas, cities and towns sprouted to take advantage of the bounty provided. Other settlements have sprung up around natural wonders that seem to inhibit the world, stunning both scholars and alchemists that travel from far and wide to visit them.  \n\nThe use of magic is commonplace in Bacresia, with most towns having at least one competent magic user. Civilian transportation, as well as local commercial traffic is mostly by horse and cart or by small trade ships traveling between ports. Airship travel is used for long distance travel across the continent, their engines powered by elemental Aethercores imbued with wind. Intercontinental travel for the vast majority involves traveling by sea, as trade winds carry large trade ships between the two continents and the archipelago.\n\n\n[History of Bacresia Timeline](https://www.worldanvil.com/w/the-world-of-bacresia-oszero/t/history-of-bacresia)","lastmodified":"2022-10-29T18:03:36.577058215Z","tags":null},"/notes/Capital-Cities/Dirik":{"title":"","content":"# Dirik\n\n![[/notes/assets/dirik.jpg]]\n\n**Type**\n\nCapital\n\n**Owning Organization**\n\n[[notes/Kingdoms and Empires/Dirikian Empire]]\n\n\n## Description\nAn architectural marvel, the capital off the [[notes/Kingdoms and Empires/Dirikian Empire]] showcases the best of it's Dwarven and Elven citizens ingenuity and craftsmanship. By melding these two contrasting architectural styles together, Dirikian craftsmen have managed to mix elegance and utilitarianism in a way unseen before.\n\n### Demographics\nOther than a small minority of humans, the vast majority of Dirik's citizens are either Dwarfs or Elves, with many proudly boasting how far back they can trace their linage back to the first settling of the mountains and surrounding grasslands.\n\n\n### Defences\nAs the city's footprint is made up of many interconnecting river islands, each island in the chain is defended by it's own walls and keep, making any sort of attempt of siege an even more slow and arduous task. \n\n\n### Industry \u0026 Trade\nAs the main hub for metal and woodcrafting in the empire, the city is home to a vast number of hordes containing millions of gold pieces worth of raw materials.  Collected from throughout the continent, the buying and selling of these commodities is carried out by a collection of auction houses run in part by the [[notes/Guilds and Organisations/Alabaster Trading Company]]. This vast network of warehouses and trade is rivalled only by city of [[notes/Capital Cities/Faymouth]], with trade disputes and shipping disruptions becoming the norm between their respective diplomats. \n\n### Infrastructure\nDirik has strong connections by both river and road, as well as a sizable airship dock open throughout the day and night. Recent improvements in [[notes/Encyclopaedia/Aethercore]] technology have resulted in renewed interest in ground-based mass transit of raw materials. News has recently spread of [[notes/Guilds and Organisations/The Alchemist Guild]] and [[notes/Kingdoms and Empires/Dirikian Empire]] artificers working on a monstrous trolley system linking the city with the great mines to the north east, increasing the amount of ore capable of being transferred by orders of magnitude.  \n\n\n### Guilds and Factions\n\n[[notes/Guilds and Organisations/Alabaster Trading Company]]\n","lastmodified":"2022-10-29T18:03:36.577058215Z","tags":null},"/notes/Capital-Cities/Fasinter":{"title":"","content":"# Fasinter\n\n![[notes/assets/fasinter.jpg]]\n**Type**\n\nCapital\n\n**Owning Organization**\n\n[[notes/Kingdoms and Empires/Kingdom of Berya]]\n\n## Description\nWith its skies filled with airships and automated barges filling the canals, Fasinter is the city that never sleeps. Relying much on the wonders of [[notes/Encyclopaedia/Aethercore|aethercore]]s  and the magitec automatons created by their famed artificers, this centre of magical learning is lauded and feared in equal measure by those outside of the kingdom. \n\n\n### Demographics\n\nThe city of Fasinter has a largely human population, making up around 70% of the inhabitants.  The remaining 30% are made up mostly of Elves (around 20%) and a small population of gnomes (10%).\n\n### Defences\n\nThe defences of Fasinter have continued to grow as the city itself has expanded over the many centuries. The most oblivious evidence of this are the multiple rings of walls which help to distinguish the different districts of the city. Looking towards the centre of the city, the many towers and multifloored buildings are dwarfed by the sheer scale of the grand citadel. Large enough to house both commercial and military airship ports within it's \"lower\" sections, this citadel was built by the first king of Berya and has been expanded upon by each royal since.\n\n### Industry \u0026 Trade\n\nA city built upon industry and trade, Fasinter's industrial and trade districts are some of the largest in the world, housing vast factories and warehouses filled with all sorts of goods ready to be sent across [[notes/Bacresia]]. Located deeper within the city limits, beyond the market and factory quarters you will find a large district filled with tall and glistening towers. Often the centre of many of the mishaps in the city, the magic and alchemy district of Fasinter is the home to many of the magical guilds of [[notes/Bacresia]], by far the largest being [[notes/Guilds and Organisations/The Alchemist Guild|The Alchemist guild]].\n\n### Infrastructure\n\nInterlaced with canals, Fasinter's main method of transporting goods around the city is aboard unmanned, [[notes/Encyclopaedia/Aethercore]]-powered barges. Often seen loaded with good and raw materials being transported from the docks situated to the south-east of the city, these barges run 24 hours a day, feeding the great Beryan industrial machine. Along with these canals, an airship dock can be found within the lower levels of the palace citadel, located at the centre of the city.\n\n\n### Guilds and Factions\n\n*   [[notes/Guilds and Organisations/The Alchemist Guild]]\n\n","lastmodified":"2022-10-29T18:03:36.577058215Z","tags":null},"/notes/Capital-Cities/Faymouth":{"title":"","content":"# Faymouth\n![[notes/assets/faymouth.jpg]]\n\n**Type**\n\nCapital\n\n**Owning Organization**\n\n[[notes/Kingdoms and Empires/Kingdom of Faymouth]]\n\n## Description\nBorn from ruins of the old Elven city, the capital city of the realm is a central trade hub for the west, importing and exporting good from across [[notes/Bacresia]]. Anything and everything is available within these borders, leading to a thriving black market. The [[Darkforest Isles]] to the north bring researchers and zoologists from around the world, flocking there to observe the unique habitats and creatures that reside there. The kingdom is protected by the native Dragonborn, using their natural leadership and strength to protect the trade caravans which travel across the continent.\n\n### Demographics\nThe great trade city has a varied demographic, filled with an assortment of people form all over the world. Dragonborn and Orcs from the east are common sights on the streets, as well as wood elves whose ancestors travelled to the mainland from the [[Darkforest Isles]] centuries ago. As with most places on the planet humans seem to have taken up residence in the city, joined by a smaller number of Goblins and Tieflings from the north.  \n\n\n### Defences\nA considerable navy defends many of the more wealthy shipping lines in and out of Faymouth, helping to drive off any opportunistic privateers hoping to plunder the riches crossing the seas to the east. Inland, the city is protected by the city guard, many of whom are mercenaries from [[notes/Guilds and Organisations/The Adventurers Guild]]\n\n\n### Industry \u0026 Trade\nDue to the sheer amount of trade occurring within it's walls, the city's entire economy is supported by trade taxes and gold spent by traders and visitors staying within the city. Because of this, most citizens make an effort to learn a trade which takes advantage of this unique scenario, resulting in a well trained and educated populace.  \n\n### Infrastructure\n\nThe city's docks are open around the clock, bringing goods too and from the city at a pace not seen anywhere else in Bacresia. Unlike the [[notes/Encyclopaedia/Aethercore]] powered machines, goods are transported throughout the city by more traditional means. \n\n\n### Districts\n\n#### Ravensway\nOne of the less affluent parts of the city, Ravensway consists of mostly residential buildings for the working population, along with the taverns and gambling establishments that often pop up around these areas of cities.\n\n#### Clear Valley\nThe centre of the city, Clear Valley houses Feymouth Castle, as well as the royal courtyard. \n\n#### The Grove\nConnected to the Breaddocks to the north, The Grove became the financial hub of the city. This district is home to most of the high end stores, as well as importers and exporters of trade goods. The centre of the district also contains what remains of it's namesakes greenery, reportedly dating back to the first Elven settlement over a thousand years ago\n\n#### Knightsbridge\nOnce the home to the kingdom's legions, Knightsbridge now houses the more wealthy citizens of the city, along with some of the nicer taverns and the area's biggest recreational area, Ivy Grove park\n\n#### East Gate\nThe industrial heart of the city, East Gate is the district that never sleeps. Dockworkers unload raw materials around the clock while smugglers sneak their wares between shipments.\n\n#### The Docks\nThe lifeblood of the city, the Breaddocks and Ghostdocks work throughout the night to load and unload cargo from the non-stop aerial and sea bound vessels of [[notes/Bacresia]].  \n\n#### Fairy Yard\nHaving once thought to house a magical portal to the Faewilds, the Fairy Yard boats a large number of magical and mundane shops mainly aimed at visitors. It's also home to one of the best magical tattooists in the realm \n\n\n### Shops\n| Name                              | Type          | Associated NPC            |\n| --------------------------------- | ------------- | ------------------------- |\n| The Shaweiger Market              | Market        |                           |\n| The New Jetty                     | Jetty         | Sarah Marsh               |\n| The Blue Laboratory               | Potion Shop   | Leya Croft                |\n| Leonus's Dependable Trading Post  | Shop          | Leonus May                |\n| Oakburn                           | Castle        | Thighflayer Lork          |\n| The Black Command Post            | Fort          | Megren Orexijandilin      |\n| The White Village Office          | Watchtower    | Robertus Head             |\n| The Ancient Jewellery Shop        | Gold Smith    | Bryanna May               |\n| The Esteemed Citrine              | Silver Smith  | Carric Mystralath         |\n| Magical Dentratha's Clothier Shop | Boutique      | Dentratha Tiammanthyilish |\n| Claira's Meat Shop                | Meat Market   | Claira Hazel              |\n| The Shaweiger Cobblers            | Boot Shop     | Aelisabeth Hall           |\n| Pleasure Palace                   | Cathouse      | Talya Ash                 |\n| The Convent of Sorrow             | Convent       | Alyxa Crump               |\n| The Town Square                   | Town Square   |                           |\n| The Alaexa Plaza Plaza            | Plaza         |                           |\n| The Bubbling Bottle               | Alchemist     | Celine Forrest            |\n| The Dungeon of Nucklestamp        | Dungeon       | Stylla Lamb               |\n| The Keep of Green                 | Keep          | Qualen Welber             |\n| The Yellow Barracks               | Fort          | Thalia Briggs             |\n| The Grim Office                   | Station       | Ront Darknath             |\n| The Platinum and Son              | Farrier Shop  | Samaentha Briar           |\n| Lorilla's Floral Shop             | Flower Shop   | Lorilla Nucklestamp       |\n| Friendly Alivya's Clothing Shop   | Garment Store | Alivya Clay               |\n| The Choice Ham                    | Meat Shop     | Joceline Hill             |\n| Porcelain Dolls                   | Bordello      | Oppah Maekkelferce        |\n| St. Nycola's Chantry              | Chantry       | Jonus Freeman             |\n| The Long-Lasting Metalsmith       | Blacksmith    | Hagren Karaktoth          |\n## Map\n\n![[notes/assets/FaymouthCityMap.png]]\n\n### Guilds and Factions\n\n[[notes/Guilds and Organisations/Alabaster Trading Company]]\n\n[[notes/Guilds and Organisations/The Adventurers Guild]]","lastmodified":"2022-10-29T18:03:36.577058215Z","tags":null},"/notes/Capital-Cities/South":{"title":"","content":"# South\n\n![](notes/assets/south.jpg \"South.jpg\")\n\n\n**Owning Organization**\n\n[[notes/Kingdoms and Empires/Conglomerate of Zaga]]\n\n### Demographics\n\nSouth is made up of a vast mixture of people, with around 55% of them claiming Orc or Half-Orc ancestry. A further 35% of the city's inhabitants are Anor humans whose ancestors travelled East from [[notes/Capital Cities/Faymouth]] into the [[notes/Kingdoms and Empires/Conglomerate of Zaga]] and settled. The other 10% is mostly made up of the Yotunni Dragonborn, many stationed in the city to act as city guard, however there are some who live in the city and enjoy a more quest life.\n\n### Defences\n\nLocated in a natural harbour, much of South is defended by the rough terrain surrounding it, with [[notes/Cultures/Dragonborn/Yotunn]]-led guardsman protecting the city and it's outskirts. The seaways of South are protected by the Conglomerate's navy, a vast number of vessels who not only protect the shipping routes from pirates, but also police the seas within Zaga's borders.\n\n### Industry \u0026 Trade\n\nSouth is home to some of the biggest and best shipwrights in the world, responsible for around 70% of all seaworthy vessels currently in use today. With waiting lists for Southern-built ships going back years, owning one of these new ships has become a status symbol in it's own right. Along with it's shipbuilding, South has a thriving fishing industry, catching much of the city's dietary needs on a nightly basis.\n\n### Infrastructure\n\nWith much of the city built on water, transporting of good and general travel around the city is done on small skiffs, many powered by magic or small [[notes/Encyclopaedia/Aethercore]] engines. Officially, all goods must go through the main harbour for custom checks and the like, however many a warehouse have been paying extra for transport ships to pull along side these establishments and unload directly into their waiting carriages, purely for the sake of efficiency. As many had predicted however this custom has created a booming black market in South, with many \"entrepreneurs\" setting up shop either at the edges of the city or upon their own skiffs.\n\n### Guilds and Factions\n\n*   [[notes/Guilds and Organisations/Alabaster Trading Company]]\n\n","lastmodified":"2022-10-29T18:03:36.577058215Z","tags":null},"/notes/Capital-Cities/The-Grand-Citadel-of-Kharia":{"title":"","content":"# The Grand Citadel of Kharia\n[![notes/assets/s/desertcitadel.jpg \"mack-sztaba-desert-citadel.jpg\")](/i/2939536 \"mack-sztaba-desert-citadel.jpg\")\n\n### History\n\n  Once thought lost to time, the ruins of the once great Citadel of Kharia stand as a testament to the strength and endurance of the **[[notes/Kingdoms and Empires/Maerokyan Empire|Maerokyan Empire]]**. Although a shadow of its former self, the city is still home to a large number of [Maerokyan](/w/the-world-of-bacresia-oszero/a/maerokyan-ethnicity) citizens, nearly all of which still follow the old ways of the empire.   Mostly made up of humans, the city also has a notable number of [[tiefling]]s that have made their home here. Unlike their [Human](/w/the-world-of-bacresia-oszero/a/human-species) neighbors, the original [Tiefling](/w/the-world-of-bacresia-oszero/a/tiefling-species) inhabitants were accidentally brought to [[notes/Bacresia]] as a result of experimental planar magic, leaving them stranded with no way of returning home. Fearful of being mistaken for demons, the chose to hide within the city walls, fearful that outsiders may harass or even violently attack them if they were seen. As generations passed however, [Tiefling](/w/the-world-of-bacresia-oszero/a/tiefling-species) and [Human](/w/the-world-of-bacresia-oszero/a/human-species) worked together and those who were once outsiders now too treated the citadel as their home.   The city is split into 5 different quarters, each with a stellar receiver at its centre. These acted as hubs and were linked with a mass transit system to allow fast and easy transportation around the city. After The Collapse, the massive burst of magical energy overloaded each of the receivers, resulting in their irreparable damage. Without a source of immense magical power, the grand magitech creations of the empire ground to a halt. Out of fear of attack from outsiders, the empire was ordered to be sunk below ground, hiding from outsiders under the desert until the stellar receivers could be repaired and the citizens could once again be safe.  \n\n### Quarters\n\n[![](notes/assets/Kharinotes/assets/y%20map.jpg \"the_grand_citadel_of_kharia.jpg\")](/i/2951689 \"the_grand_citadel_of_kharia.jpg\")\n\n#### Nights Borough\n\nHousing nearly all of the residents of Kharia, the Nights Borough is the main residential district of Kharia. The houses here are made of limestone quarried from the rock around the city. Although some may find them plain on the outside, most homes are furnished incredibly well, filled with ornate wooden furniture and woven tapastries. Along with the citizens housing, the Nights Borough is also the centre of culture and entertainment within the walls. Most nights the sounds of applause and merriment echo down the streets as laborers, craftsmen and researchers relax after a long day. Some establishments of notable repute include:    \n\n#### Sahir District\n\nLocated to the East, the magical district of the citadel is nearly always bustling with activity. The tall stone towers can be seen from anywhere in the city and act as waymarks for those who find themselves lost exploring the winding streets. Mostly made up of schools and guilds dedicated to the 8 types of magic, there are also still a small collection of mages attempting to develop ways to repair the magitech of old. As the centre of learning, the schools and colleges for both young and old are found here. Below the streets of the Sahir District is the location of The Eternal Falls, a magical source of water which is them pumped throughout the city and to the other underground towns of the empire. As it is such an important part of the empires infrustruture, The Eternal Falls are guarded as heavily as The Emperors Palace.  \n\n#### Starfall Quarter\n\nNamed after the meteorites that were once the source of iron for the empire, the Starfall Quarter is the industrial heart of the citadel and home to the craftsmen and artisans who work with metals and precious stones from the earth. The enormous factories which once built magitech machines soon fell into disuse after the calamity, however most were repurposed and many are still inhabited to this day. With no sustainable source of coal or other fuel for their forges, the blacksmiths here have become accustomed to using magical fire for their craft. Although this doesn't necessarily impart any magic into the blades, it does give the metal an azure hue, the signature of a Maerokyan-manufactured weapon.  \n\n#### The Golden Scales\n\nFilled to the brim with shops and stores, The Golden Scales is a bustling hub of mercantile activity. Traders from throughout the empire not only bring their wares to the bazaar, but also news and information from across the empire. Having once been one of the most advances realms of [[notes/Bacresia]], it's not uncommon for strange and fantastical relics or weapons to find themselves in shop windows. To help curb the proliferation of dangerous magical artefacts, the empires economy revolves around a license system, limiting who can buy and sell items within different tiers. The tier in which an item is place is decided by mages employed by the city, who also keep a ledger of all magical items bought and sold within the walls.  \n\n#### Iron Barracks\n\nThe Iron Barracks the military and judicial quarter of the city and is the home of The Sanguine Shroud, a highly trained and well equipped military force. Acting as the standing army of the empire, members of the shroud are tasked with expeditions into the Underdark. The courthouse (known as The House of Adl) is found at the centre and is surrounded by guildhouses and combat academies whose doors are open to the pubic for a fee. Police patrols and guard duties are carried out by The Golden Fleece, a reserve force made up of new recruits and older veterans nearing their time in the armed forces of the **[[notes/Kingdoms and Empires/Maerokyan Empire|Maerokyan Empire]]**.\n\n**Location under**\n\n[[notes/Places of Interest  Natural Wonders/The Jangwa Desert]]\n\n**Owning Organization**\n\n[[notes/Kingdoms and Empires/Maerokyan Empire]]","lastmodified":"2022-10-29T18:03:36.577058215Z","tags":null},"/notes/Capital-Cities/Velgekh":{"title":"","content":"# Velgekh\n\n![](notes/assets/velgekh.jpg \"Velgekh.jpg\")\u003cimg src=\"\"/\u003e\n\n**Type**\n\nCapital\n\n**Owning Organization**\n\n[[notes/Kingdoms and Empires/Nablin]]\n\n## Description\nThe city of a hundred towers, Velgekh considers itself the only truly free city in [[notes/Bacresia]]. It's people enjoy an unprecedented amount of freedom and are welcome to to conduct themselves in any manor which does not directly harm others. As with most rules however there are many who a happy to bend them and as such Velgekh has a reputation for being the usual destination for those with more questionable ethics. Because of this however, [[notes/Kingdoms and Empires/Nablin|Nablin]] weapons and medical programs have always been at the pinnacle of research.\n\n\n### Demographics\nMostly made up of Dwarves and Humans, there are a small number of Elves who call the city their home. Nearly all of the inhabitants of Velgekh can trace their linage back to the original population who fought in the second guild war and are directly responsible for the creation of [[notes/Kingdoms and Empires/Nablin]]\n\n\n### Defences\nHaving a long tradition of working with outsiders for defence, the city is primarily defended by adventurers from many of the guilds that call the city home. These adventurers are paid for their time and are equipped by the city, although it's not uncommon for each group to customise their gear.\n\n\n### Industry \u0026 Trade\nWith most of [[notes/Kingdoms and Empires/Nablin|Nablin]]'s lands incredibly fertile, much of Velgekh's economy is based around the exporting of food throughout the continent, being used to feed both the [[notes/Kingdoms and Empires/Kingdom of Berya]] and [[notes/Kingdoms and Empires/Dirikian Empire]]. The necessity of these food imports is what gives the city and nation the political influence to stop themselves being swallowed by either of the great nations. \n\n\n### Infrastructure\nAs a city with unrivalled verticality, Nablini craftsmen and artificers spent decades trying to develop a transport system which would allow for fast and safe travel around the city. Taking inspiration from their vast aerial navy and they developed a fleet of skiffs that transport citizens and cargo between the towers.    \n\n\n### Guilds and Factions\n\n*   [[notes/Guilds and Organisations/The Alchemist Guild]]\n\n","lastmodified":"2022-10-29T18:03:36.577058215Z","tags":null},"/notes/Capital-Cities/Whitharf":{"title":"","content":"# Whitharf\n\n![](notes/assets/whitharf.jpg \"Whitharf.jpg\")\n\n**Type**\n\nCapital\n\n**Owning Organization**\n\n[[notes/Kingdoms and Empires/Draia]]\n\n## Description\nNestled at the foot of a sleeping volcano, Whitharf and her people are no strangers to the perils of living in a hostile environment. A city of metalworkers and stonemasons, each gives their time to protect and support the city, whether by keeping the city's infrastructure protected against the corrosive gasses that seep from the surrounding mountains or arming themselves to defend against the hordes of elementals which seem to accompany volcanic eruptions. Overlooking the city are two bronze titans, protectors of the city. \n\n\n### Demographics\nDue to the harsh and inhospitable lands, most of of the original inhabitants of the continent found themselves here by necessity. This shows in the population, as nearly all of the citizens are descendants of those who first landed on these shores centuries ago. Because of this, nearly all the population are humans, with small collections of tieflings who seem unfazed by the warm and dry climate. \n\n\n### Defences\nDue to the unique appearance of elemental hordes which besiege the city on a quinquennial basis, Whitharf is by far the most well defended of all of the capital cities of [[notes/Bacresia]]. The city walls themselves sit at 30ft, with defensive towers overlooking the city and it's surrounding lands. To help repel any invaders, the city guard are outfitted and trained as a standing army, ready to come to the city's defence at a moments notice. \n\n\n### Industry \u0026 Trade\nHome to a forging technique which is found nowhere else on the planet, Draian steel is an extremely hot commodity. Used in many specialist applications such as [[notes/Encyclopaedia/Aethercore]] engines and high quality weapon manufacture, many smiths will travel to [[notes/Kingdoms and Empires/Draia|Draia]] to learn about this amazing material \n\n### Infrastructure\nConstant ash clouds make air travel difficult, so much of the trade flowing through the city occurs via cargo ships or along the vast road network that covers the continent. Although often damaged by the earthquakes, these roads are quickly repaired and used by most on a daily basis.\n\n\n","lastmodified":"2022-10-29T18:03:36.577058215Z","tags":null},"/notes/Character-Creation/Character-Creation":{"title":"","content":"TBD","lastmodified":"2022-10-29T18:03:36.577058215Z","tags":null},"/notes/Continents/Central-Archipelago":{"title":"","content":"# Central Archipelago\n\n[![](notes/assets/central%20islands.jpg \"Southern Sun Isles.jpg\")](/i/2481300 \"Southern Sun Isles.jpg\")\n\nLocated in the southern ocean between [[notes/Continents/Valodur]] and [[notes/Continents/Dacia]], the Central Archipelago (colloquially known as the South Sun Isles) is home to many a trading outpost, as well as holiday destination for the more wealthy citizens of [[notes/Bacresia]].

The vast amount of rain and warm equatorial temperatures have resulted in the lowlands being covered in dense forest. Much of these lands were levelled for inhabitation and agricultural use, but large areas of temperate rainforest still exist, the home of smaller hunting villages and sages. The world seems to have only 2 seasons, summer and winter. Summers Last for the majority of the year, providing a warm and fertile growing season. Large Winters come abruptly and result in a near shutdown of most of the agricultural industries of the world. The long summers however allow adequate store of food to be kept, with famine a worry most in the world have not had in generations.  \nDue to the wet climate, winters are often icy and traveling becomes difficult. Many of the rivers freeze in the winter months and airships have trouble remaining in the air at higher latitudes. Geologically the land is quiet, although the volcanic islands of Draia have many peaks which spew ash and lava on a daily basis. Earthquakes are much more common during the winter, with the vast majority occurring within the first weeks of snowfall.  \n  \n  \nTime and dates are similar to the real world, with 30 day months and 12 month years. Each of the summer months in Bacresia are named after a member of The Pantheon of Creation, the collection of Gods who created the planet and lived amongst the people of Bacresia during the Celestial Era. The days are 24 hours long with the twin moons of Oberon and Titania gracing the skies at night.  \nMust of the land is temperate, however the topography of Bacresia results in some vastly different and clearly separate biomes. Though uncommon, it is not unknown to find large quantities of resources within small patches of land. Acres of land with unrivalled fertility or tons of easily accessible surface ore have been found throughout Bacresia and as many people flocked to these areas, cities and towns sprouted to take advantage of the bounty provided. Other settlements have sprung up around natural wonders that seem to inhibit the world, stunning both scholars and alchemists that travel from far and wide to visit them.  \n\nThe use of magic is commonplace in Bacresia, with most towns having at least one competent magic user. Civilian transportation, as well as local commercial traffic is mostly by horse and cart or by small trade ships traveling between ports. Airship travel is used for long distance travel across the continent, their engines powered by elemental Aethercores imbued with wind. Intercontinental travel for the vast majority involves traveling by sea, as trade winds carry large trade ships between the two continents and the archipelago.\n\n\n[History of Bacresia Timeline](https://www.worldanvil.com/w/the-world-of-bacresia-oszero/t/history-of-bacresia)","lastmodified":"2022-10-29T18:03:36.617058776Z","tags":null},"/notes/Wildspace/The-Moons-of-Bacresia":{"title":"","content":"# Oberon and Titania\n\n![](notes/assets/twinmoons.png \"twinmoons.png\")\n\nThe twin moons of Oberon and Titania are a common sight in the Bacresian sky, often depicted as guardians of the planet in old folktales. \nOberon, the largest of the two moons was stuck my something long ago, shattering it's surface and spewing glowing regolith into [[notes/Wildspace/Wildspace]].
